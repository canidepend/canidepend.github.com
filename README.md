CanIDepend on X already?
------------------------

An index of often used libraries and interpreters on commonly used Linux
distros.

New maintainer needed
---------------------

The current maintainer (@pwaring) no longer has time to keep things
up to date, and therefore the project is looking for a new maintainer.
The main responsibilities are:

* Responding to pull requests and issues
* Uploading new release data (ideally this would be automated)
* Renewing the canidepend.com domain

Hosting is provided by GitHub Pages, which the domain name points to.

If you are interested in taking over maintenance of the project, please
contact @pwaring via email: paul@xk7.net


Enterprise Linux data
---------------------

We have file listings of EL install media in data-sources/. While these
won't always be the latest data, it's a good starting point.


How to contribute
-----------------

* Fork this project
